- ## **Project Overview**
YouTube's user count ofÂ 2.49 billionÂ places it second on the list of most-used social media platforms.
Not only youtube there are more social media platforms like facebook,instagram,x(Twitter) etc.
that have billions of users.so these are the source of alot of unstructured data like text ,image and videos.
So in this projects we had worked on text data like comments from youtube video.
We perform [sentiment analysis](https://www.ibm.com/topics/sentiment-analysis) on a youtube video joe biden and donald trump presidential debate video that was broadcast  
live on wall street journal channel this is the video link  [TRUMP VS BIDEN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE) .actually we have used this video comments for example purpose how to perform sentiment analysis on youtube comments.the project aim is simple we need to understand the opinion of public using comments on this presidential debate,we want to know which candidates viewers wants to see the president of USA.In this project first we will classify sentiment using textblob and in the second approach we will use pretrained Large language model(LLM) to predict the sentiment.in overall project we have done alot of  steps from [ETL(extract transform load)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/etl-process-in-data-warehouse/) to data analysis.
After the project compilation we will compare the both approach and analyse the result.I found in this project llm performance  are better compare to simple classic classifications method.easy to implement and alot of boiler plate code reduced.
In the llm sentiment analysis we have implemented pattern matching using [regular expression](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html) and extracting of entity/keyword from the text.
Keyword/entity extraction is crucial for sentiment score analysis on  more specific
Entities.
